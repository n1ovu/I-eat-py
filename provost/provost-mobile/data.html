While the same information can be presented in tabular format, a histogram makes it easier to identify different data, the frequency of its occurrence and categories. It has two axis, one horizontal and the other vertical. Another name for a histogram is a bar chart.</p></details></li>

The pictorial representation of a grouped data, in the form of vertical or horizontal rectangular bars, where the lengths of the bars are equivalent to the measure of data, are known as bar graphs or bar charts.</p></details></li>
                    <li><details><summary><a href="#">Highlight tables</a></summary><p>You can use them to quickly identify high and low points in your data. They’re often used to complement bar and line charts. One good use of highlight tables is to compare specific values found within a row or column. They’re good for highlighting trends in marketing or comparing sales numbers between different sales reps.</p></details></li>

                                <li><span>Column charts</span>, an inverse of bar charts, are a common and popular visualization tool. Marketers can use them to track the number of visitors on a landing page or those funneled through specific social media channels. Using consistent colors on a column chart visualization gives it more impact and helps the viewer focus on the presented information.</li>
                                <li><span>Dashboard visualizations</span> are an excellent way for business areas to clarify their work in a centralized location. Having all available data analytics in one place allows organizations to quickly gain an objective view of what’s happening in different areas of a company.</li>
                                <li><span>Heat maps</span> are the go-to visual charts for showcasing a vast amount of numerical data. Many heat maps use warmer colors to showcase high-value data clusters and cooler colors for those of less importance.</li>
                                <li><span>Dual-axis charts</span> let you place data along two Y-axes that both use the same X-axis. These types of visualizations are good for displaying information from different data sets, where one of which is continuous. The other data set should contain information capable of being grouped into specific buckets for different categories. A dual-axis chart is good for looking for correlations among the three sets of information.</li>
                                <li><span>Word clouds</span>, or tag clouds, are created from data sources like a speech, online conversation, or database that highlights how many times specific words appeared in the text. More frequently used words are larger and more prominent while outliers and words used less often appear smaller. Businesses can use text clouds to help them compare two seemingly disconnected pieces of information and find similarities that might point toward the solution to an ongoing issue. Word clouds from online customer reviews can also point to reasons for customer dissatisfaction.</li>
