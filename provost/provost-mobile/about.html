    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <section class="about">
        <p>Fluent in programming languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and also SQL, JSON and XML. Also familiar with data science libraries such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup4, and Matplotlib. We have been building web pages and developing data science programs for three years. We have recently decided to freelance our web & data services. This website is a continuing build because it's where we will be displaying our work and skills, still under construction as we work on our clients websites. This is a family business, after teaching my grandchildren, (one how to build web pages and the other how to work with data), they will be business partners.</p>
